	<p class="block-text">In this experiment, we will be testing your short-term memory.<p>
    <p class="block-text">On each trial, you will see circles of different sizes and colors displayed at random locations on the screen. Your job is to remember the sizes of the blue and red circles, while ignoring the green circles. The circles will be shown for 1.5 seconds, followed by a 1 second delay with nothing on the screen. After the delay, a single black circle will appear with a random size at the location of one of the original red or blue circles.</p>
    <p class="block-text">When the black circle appears, change its size by moving your mouse up and down until it matches the original circle at that location as best you remember. When you believe you have matched the original size, click the mouse to lock in your answer and start the next trial. There will be 30 trials in total.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Because the stimuli are going to be delivered quickly and we will be testing your memory, it is important that you minimize distractions as much as possible. If your browser has a "full screen" mode, please enable it, or at least close any other tabs that may draw your attention.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Once you click "Start", please complete the experiment without interruptions. If you need a snack or a trip to the bathroom, please do that now. When ready, click "Start" to begin. The first trial will happen one second after clicking.</p>
