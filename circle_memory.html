	<p class="block-text">In this experiment, we will be testing your short-term memory. On each trial, you'll see circles of different sizes and colors displayed on the screen. Remember the sizes of the blue and red circles (ignore the green circles). After a one-second delay, a single circle of a random size will appear in black at the location of one of the original circles. Move your mouse up and down until the black circle matches the size you remember the circle that was originally at that position being. When you believe you have matched the size as best you remember, click the mouse to lock in your answer and start the next trial. There will be 30 trials in total.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Once you click "Start", please complete the experiment without interruptions. If you need a snack or a trip to the bathroom, please do that now. Once you are ready, click "Start" to begin. The first trial will begin one second after clicking.</p>
