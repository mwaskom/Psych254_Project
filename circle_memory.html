	<p class="block-text">In this experiment, we will be testing your short-term memory.</p>
    <p class="block-text">On each trial, you will see circles of different sizes and colors displayed at random locations on the screen. <strong>Remember the sizes of the blue and red circles, but ignore the green circles.</strong> As example, you might see a display that looks like this:</p>
    <img src="images/example_array.png" alt="Example stimulus" width=400 style="padding:10px;">
    <p class="block-text">The circles will be shown for 1.5 seconds, followed by a 1 second delay with nothing on the screen. After the delay, a single black circle will appear at the location of one of the original red or blue circles.</p>
    <p class="block-text">When the black circle appears, change its size by moving your mouse up and down until it matches the original circle at that location as best you remember. <strong>When you believe you have matched the original size, click the mouse to lock in your answer and start the next trial.</strong> There will be 30 trials in total.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Because the stimuli are going to be delivered quickly and we will be testing your memory, it is important that you minimize distractions as much as possible. <strong>Please close or minimize any other tabs that may draw your attention.</strong></p>
    <p class="block-text">When ready, click "Start" to begin. The first trial will happen one second after clicking. Please try to complete the experiment without any interruptions.</p>
